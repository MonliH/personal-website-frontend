## personal website frontend

Frontend of my personal website, live at [jonat.li](https:/jonat.li). There is a seperate [backend repo](https://github.com/monlih/personal-website-backend) with a nice diagram showing the architecture of the blog. This site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and uses
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with React).
